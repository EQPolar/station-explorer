# Station Explorer

The project will create a mashup of various APIs to create allow the user to explorer information about UK train stations.

The main interface will consist of a map with place markers for various UK train stations.  The user will be able to click on the map indicator to bring up a modal window that shows the following:
* Station name / postcode 
* Current weather
* Wikipedia blurb
* Image
* Live departure and arrival info

Each section will have a link that will allow the user to click and go to an external link with information about that topic. For example, postcode will take the user to a new window on Google Maps with the postcode location set.
